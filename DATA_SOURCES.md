# Data Sources: Synthetic Breast Cancer Risk Dataset

## Overview
This project uses a synthetic dataset generated specifically for the Check Me triage application. The data simulates realistic relationships between risk factors and breast cancer risk levels, designed to train a triage model.

**Source**: Generated by the (**generate_data.py**) script
**Size**: 5,000 samples
**Format**: CSV (**synthetic_breast_cancer_risk.csv**)

## Fields and Assumptions

| Field | Type | Description | Assumptions / Generation Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **age** | Integer | Patient age (18-90) | Skewed towards older ages using a Beta distribution. |
| **family_history** | Binary (0/1) | History of breast cancer in immediate family | ~15% prevalence. Strong risk factor. |
| **previous_lumps** | Binary (0/1) | History of benign lumps | Correlated with age. |
| **breast_pain** | Binary (0/1) | Sensation of pain | Common in benign conditions (rule of thumb: pain often != cancer, but still a symptom to track). |
| **nipple_discharge** | Binary (0/1) | Fluid discharge | Rare (10% of symptomatic cases), but a moderate risk indicator. |
| **skin_dimples** | Binary (0/1) | Dimpling of breast skin | Very rare (5% of symptomatic cases), but a **major** red flag. |
| **lump_size_mm** | Float | Size of palpable lump in mm | Gamma distributed (10-50mm typical). Only present if has_lump is true. NaN otherwise. Larger lumps = higher risk. |
| **symptom_duration_days** | Integer | Duration of symptoms | Exponential distribution. Longer duration without care increases risk urgency. |
| **pregnancy_status** | Binary (0/1) | Currently pregnant | Relevant for hormonal context. |
| **hormonal_contraception** | Binary (0/1) | Using hormonal BC | Slight risk increase factor (modeled as noise/minor factor). |
| **region** | Categorical | Geographic region | Used to simulate demographic variety (Rwandan provinces). |
| **language** | Categorical | Preferred language | Used for demo UI personalization (not risk). |
| **risk_level** | Integer (0-2) | **Target Variable**: 0=Green, 1=Yellow, 2=Red | Derived from a weighted sum of risk factors + noise. |

## Label Generation Logic
The **risk_level** target was created using a scoring system:
- **Base Score**: 0
- **Additions**:
    - Ag > 50 (+2), Age > 40 (+1)
    - Family History (+3)
    - Skin Dimples (+5) **(High impact)**
    - Nipple Discharge (+3)
    - Large Lumps (>50mm: +4, >20mm: +2)
- **Noise**: Gaussian noise added to simulate real-world uncertainty.
- **Thresholds**:
    - Score > 6 -> **Red (High Risk)**
    - Score > 3 -> **Yellow (Medium Risk)**
    - Else -> **Green (Low Risk)**

## Limitations
- This data is **strictly synthetic** and does not represent real patient records.
- Correlations are based on general medical knowledge but simplified for a coding demonstration.
- It should **not** be used for actual medical diagnosis or research.
